# Description

This repository contains the source code of an implementation for the popular "Space Invaders" game.
This is a DOS game and the source code was tested with "Borland C++ 3.1".

# Compile steps

1. Use a DOS emulator (eg. "DOSBox"), unless you're running on a 16-bit OS like MS-DOS.
2. Compile the source code with "Borland C++ 3.X".
3. Please make sure that graphical assets with ".nik" extension are beside the compiled binary when running.

# Why this old code is on github?

The code's main purpose was to ilustrate how things worked back then, being used in some didactic activities.
Fell free to contribute.
